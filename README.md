## api reference

### bypass urls

```http
  GET /api/bypass
```

| Parameter      | Type     | Description                                                                                |
| :------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`          | `string` | **Required**. Base 64/URI encoded URL to bypass.                                           |
| `ignoreBypass` | `string` | Ignores cache of previous attempts to bypass the URL, only use if the result is incorrect. |

#### Response

**Successful response**:

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "url": "https://github.com/",
    "fromArchive": true
}
```

`success` is whether or not the process succeeded, in this instance - it's `true`.

`url` contains the URL Lilypad found.

`fromArchive` shows whether or not it was from a previously cached bypass.

**Unsuccessful response**:

```json
{
    "success": false,
    "err": {
        "stack": "HTTPError: Response code 403 (Forbidden)\n    at Request.<anonymous> (/app/node_modules/got/dist/source/as-promise/index.js:117:42)\n    at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:95:5)"
        "message": "Response code 403 (Forbidden)"
        "code": "HTTPError"
    }
}
```

`success` is whether or not the process succeeded, in this instance - it's `false`.

`err` is an object that has `stack`, `message` and `code` strings, sometimes certain strings are missing.

## special thanks
- This was inspired by [Universal Bypass](https://universal-bypass.org/) and some code on the server was adapted from it.

- [README.so](https://readme.so/) was partially used to generate this README.

- Some code was also used from an attempt of this project a bit farther back - [here](https://github.com/normanlol/bypass-api).

- This project is also possible thanks to [AntiCaptcha](http://getcaptchasolution.com/rpsgehhafa) (uses referal link).
